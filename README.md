## Overview
The Age Calculator app is a front-end coding challenge provided by Frontend Mentor. The goal is to build a web application that allows users to calculate their age in years, months, and days based on a provided birthdate. The app should adhere closely to the provided design files for both desktop and mobile views

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

I created this project by setting up a GitHub repository and organizing the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The HTML structure includes a form for entering a birthdate, while CSS ensures the design matches specifications and is responsive. JavaScript handles form submission, validates inputs, calculates age, and manages error messages. I thoroughly tested the app across various devices and browsers to ensure functionality. Finally, I deployed the project on GitHub Pages for public access.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development
*   **Enhanced User Interface**: Implement a more visually appealing design with modern UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
    
*   **Additional Features**: Integrate more functionalities such as calculating age in months, weeks, or days. Allow users to compare ages or calculate age differences between two dates.
    
*   **Localization**: Support multiple languages and date formats to cater to a broader audience.
    
*   **Data Persistence**: Add functionality to save user preferences or previous calculations using local storage or backend/database integration.
    
*   **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhance error messages and validation to provide more informative feedback to users.
    
*   **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing ARIA attributes and testing with accessibility tools.
    
*   **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the app's performance by minimizing resource usage and improving loading times.
    
*   **Mobile App Conversion**: Convert the web app into a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter for wider platform support.
    
*   **Integration with APIs**: Incorporate external APIs for additional data inputs or to enhance functionality, such as retrieving historical events based on the birthdate entered.
    
*   **User Feedback**: Implement a feedback mechanism to gather user suggestions and improve the app based on user input.
Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
